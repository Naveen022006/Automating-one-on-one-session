# Marketplace essentials: what was built, and where it differs from the plan

The plan is `doc/13-product-build-plan.md` (read it first; it holds the reasoning, the rules every work package follows and the
acceptance walk-throughs). This file is the record of the build: one section per work package, written by the implementer of that
package, with their **deviations from the plan** (what, why, date) and anything the next person must know. The foundation branch
(`mk/00-foundation`) created this file; its own deviations are in `doc/13-deviations.md`.

In one paragraph: six features turn the app from "a booking tool" into something a platform owner can run as a marketplace that holds
other people's money. **A** lets an administrator suspend an influencer (and, opt-in, approve a page before it goes live). **B** gives
the admin CSV exports, refunds of captured payments, platform-side cancellation and booking search. **C** records an activity log of each
influencer account, visible to the influencer and to the admin. **D** is the customer portal ("find your bookings" by e-mail, data export,
erasure, receipts). **E** repairs reminders after a worker or Redis outage. **F** is the admin finance report (what is held, owed and
to recover). The foundation branch changed every shared file once (schema, routes, router, nav, rate limits, stubs) so the six branches
touch only their own files. Rules for a placeholder: a page that still says "Coming soon" at release time is a defect (grep for it).

Write your section as you go; keep it short and dated. Do not edit another package's section.
